# Infotangles
Like rectangles. But tangled. With info. 
I have big plans for this place.

## My Promises To You:
### 1. **First, DOWN WITH DIGITAL SUPREMACY.**
I am bringing back the analog clock. All of them. Wall, watch, circle, square, hexagon, eischer, color wheel, counterclockwise-running, clockwise-running, television embeddable, Dali, Big Ben, sundial, water, quartz, bell, pendulum, atomic, general vibe, and penguin live cams will all be added as official time-keeping options!

### 2. **I STAND BY TEMPORAL FREEDOM.** 
Still want the digital clock? No worries, it's staying! Not only that, I will be adding the ability to CHANGE FONT SIZE! And it doesn't stop there. Ever feel like yo just couldn't adjust it as small as you wanted? Well now you can! 5x5px numbers! Don't need be reminded of your own mortality with a timer that counts down the days? Get rid of the days and live in the moment! Hell, hate the concept of time altogether? You can now remove any unit of time!* Want to know what time it is London? Use cobalt tab. Pluto? Infotangles. Change the speed, add more hands, add more numbers, grow a plant, raise a hamster, it's your clock!

##### *Removing time from your Infotangles may cause severe instability, loss of causality, confusion, and nothing.*

### 3. WE'RE BRINGING ROCKS BACK TO EARTH!
Sure, NASA photos are great. Beautiful, pseudo-colorful space rocks of death beyond our comprehension. But you know where else has rocks? Earth. When's the last time you appreciated a rock? I believe that if everybody had just a little more basalt in their lives, the world would be a better place. NASA library to be replaced with the GREAT LIBRARY OF ROCKS! Stored in a community database that anyone in the world can add to seamlessly using our upcoming mobile app!

### 4. Infotangles: Minecraft Edition.
Turn your infotangles into mathematically perfect infosquares to unlock infocubes.
